Next.js 15 introduces Turbopack as the default development server, bringing unprecedented speed improvements to your development workflow. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to get started and make the most of these powerful tools.

## What is Turbopack?

Turbopack is a next-generation bundler written in Rust, designed to replace Webpack in Next.js applications. It offers:

- **10x faster startup time** compared to Webpack
- **Incremental compilation** for instant updates
- **Built-in HMR** (Hot Module Replacement) that just works
- **Optimized for large codebases** with thousands of modules

## Key Features of Next.js 15

### 1. Enhanced Performance

Next.js 15 comes with significant performance improvements:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15</h1>
      <p>Experience the speed of Turbopack</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Server Components by Default

All components are Server Components by default, reducing client-side JavaScript:

```typescript
// This runs on the server
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Improved Routing

The App Router continues to evolve with better patterns:

```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return <article>Post: {params.slug}</article>;
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project with Turbopack:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --turbopack
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Server Components** - Keep client components minimal
2. **Optimize Images** - Use the built-in Image component
3. **Leverage Static Generation** - Pre-render pages when possible
4. **Code Splitting** - Turbopack handles this automatically

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 with Turbopack represents a significant leap forward in web development tooling. The combination of speed, developer experience, and production optimization makes it an excellent choice for modern web applications.
