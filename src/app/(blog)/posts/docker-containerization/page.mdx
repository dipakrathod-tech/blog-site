# Mastering Docker Containerization

Docker has revolutionized the way we build, ship, and run applications. This guide will take you from Docker basics to advanced containerization strategies that you can apply in production environments.

## Why Docker?

Docker solves the classic "it works on my machine" problem by providing:

- **Consistency** across development, staging, and production
- **Isolation** of applications and their dependencies
- **Portability** - run anywhere Docker is supported
- **Efficiency** - lightweight compared to VMs
- **Scalability** - easy to scale horizontally

## Docker Fundamentals

### Understanding Images and Containers

A Docker **image** is a template, while a **container** is a running instance:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Building Your First Image

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop <container-id>
```

## Multi-Stage Builds

Optimize your images with multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

This approach reduces the final image size significantly!

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Apps

Manage multiple containers with Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://db:5432/myapp
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Start everything with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Official Base Images

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine  # Good
# vs
FROM ubuntu:latest   # Not recommended
```

### 2. Minimize Layers

```dockerfile
# Bad - multiple layers
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y package1
RUN apt-get install -y package2

# Good - single layer
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. Use .dockerignore

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.env
*.md
.vscode
```

### 4. Health Checks

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Run as non-root user**:

```dockerfile
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs
```

2. **Scan images for vulnerabilities**:

```bash
docker scan my-app:1.0
```

3. **Use specific image versions**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20.10.0-alpine  # Good
# vs
FROM node:latest          # Avoid
```

## Production Deployment

### Using Docker with Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:1.0
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```

## Conclusion

Docker containerization is an essential skill for modern DevOps practices. By following these best practices and patterns, you can build efficient, secure, and scalable containerized applications.

Start small, experiment with simple applications, and gradually adopt more advanced patterns as you grow comfortable with Docker's ecosystem.
